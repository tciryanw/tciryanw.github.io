### Client front testing app for hardware slotmachine remake
For portfolio, remaking a hardware slots, replacing all it's internals and remaking the game logic completely, this is a supporting testing app.

It will be for testing RTP while developing the hardware slot's logic and in the end will be a light-board where you can see hardware slot's current machine state from remote as admin and adjust rtp settings etc.

Currently unfinished while I think how I am to implement the hardware slot's power level bar.
