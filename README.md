# Snakes & Ladders Frontend
Frontend test app for Thrills 'n Spills hardware slotmachine software remake.

## Client front testing app for hardware slotmachine remake
For portfolio I am remaking a broken barcrest 1993 slotmachine. 

Replacing all it's old internals and remaking the game logic completely, this is a supporting testing app.

This client is for testing RTP while developing the hardware slot's logic/software, after completing this will remain within admin panel and serve as real-time lights-board.
