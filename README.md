### Client front testing app for hardware slotmachine remake
For portfolio, remaking a hardware slots, replacing all it's internals and remaking the game logic completely, this is a supporting testing app.

This client is for testing RTP while developing the hardware slot's logic/software, after completing this will remain within admin panel and serve as real-time lights-board.

Panel will log all previous events, vtp, cash-in, cash-out and so on where this will be part of lights-board to see and review hardware slot's current machine state.


## State
Currently unfinished while I think how I am to implement the hardware slot's power level bar.



## Hardware Slot
This frontend is representing a hardware slotmachine layout. This slotmachine is called 'Thrills n spills' and was made by Barcrest, made in 1993.
